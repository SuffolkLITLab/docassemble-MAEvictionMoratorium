  A flow for allowing signers to sign on the device with which they are most comfortable.

  `generic object` is being used to allow more flexibility for developers using this module.
  
  ## Limitations:
  - Right now the signer can't pick any device they want. It only differentiates between using a computer and a mobile device. A mobile device will always only present a signature. The execution order for handling multiple devices is complex unless it's broken into multiple interviews.
