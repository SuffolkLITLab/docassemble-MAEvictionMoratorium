  Motion to Dismiss - Essential Eviction
subquestion: |  
  Massachusetts has an eviction moratorium. Most people cannot get evicted in Massachusetts before: 
  
  * August 18, 2020, or, 
  *	Until 45 days after the Governor lifts the state of emergency,
  whichever comes first.  
  
  This is called the eviction moratorium. But you **can** get evicted if you risk the health and safety of someone else by:
  
  *	getting involved in criminal activity, or,
  *	violating your lease.
  
  This interview helps you defend against an eviction that should not have
  been filed against you.
