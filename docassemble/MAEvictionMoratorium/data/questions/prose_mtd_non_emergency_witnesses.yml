question: |
  Motion to Dismiss - Essential Eviction
subquestion: |  
  Massachusetts has an eviction moratorium. Most people cannot get evicted in Massachusetts before: 
  
  * August 18, 2020, or, 
  *	Until 45 days after the Governor lifts the state of emergency,
  whichever comes first.  
  
  This is called the eviction moratorium. But you **can** get evicted if you risk the health and safety of someone else by:
  
  *	Getting involved in criminal activity, or,
  *	Violating your lease.
  
  This interview helps defend against an eviction your landlord should not have filed.

  This interview is not for you
subquestion: |
  You said your eviction was filed because you risked someone's health and safety.
  
  In some cases, you can still get the eviction dismissed even if you think you are risking someone's health or safety. 
  
  But talk to a lawyer because this makes it complicated.

  If you cannot file this motion or [talk to a lawyer](https://masslegalhelp.org/find-legal-aid), you can still fight your eviction case. Create an answer using [this free guided interview tool](https://www.gbls.org/MADE).
