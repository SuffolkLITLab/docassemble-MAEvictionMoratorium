  Motion to Dismiss - Essential Eviction
subquestion: |  
  Massachusetts has an eviction moratorium. Most people cannot get evicted in Massachusetts before: 
  
  * October 18, 2020, or, 
  * Until 45 days after the Governor lifts the state of emergency,
  whichever comes first.  
  
  This is called the eviction moratorium. But you **can** get evicted if you risk the health and safety of someone else by:
  
  * Getting involved in criminal activity, or,
  * Violating your lease.
  
  This interview helps defend against an eviction your landlord should not have filed.

  In some cases, you can still get the eviction dismissed even if you think you are risking someone's health or safety. 
  
  But talk to a lawyer because this makes it complicated.
