  Some pre-made functionality for mutli-user signatures.

  ## Definitions:
  `remote` in here refers to devices of signers other than the user or those using the user's device.
  
  ## Limitations:
  - Remote users never see the doc update (not MVP)
  
  As usual, these can all be customized. It just hopes these help save brain cells.
